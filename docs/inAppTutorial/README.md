# In-App Tutorial

An in-app tutorial is a sequenced step by step tutorial that is displayed to the user directly in the editor.
It reacts to user actions through different ways that are explained below.

GDevelop created its own components and orchestrator so that one can create a whole tutorial with only a JSON file. They are greatly inspired by [Userflow](https://userflow.com) work.

You can have a look at the components in [the editor storybook](https://gdevelop-storybook.s3.amazonaws.com/master/latest/index.html?path=/story/in-app-tutorial-elementhighlighterandtooltipdisplayer--default).
